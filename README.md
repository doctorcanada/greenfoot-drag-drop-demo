## greenfoot-drag-drop-demo

This example illustrates how you can use the mouse to drag and drop objects in a game or other Greenfoot scenario. It also makes use of proper _encapsulation_ (private fields, accessible by public `get` and `set` methods) while demonstrating _interactions between objects_ (e.g., having an Actor object communicate with the World). 

**Hope you find it useful! :smile:**
