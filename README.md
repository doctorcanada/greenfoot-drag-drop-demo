## greenfoot-drag-drop-demo

This example illustrates how you can use the mouse to drag and drop objects in a game or other Greenfoot scenario. It also makes use of proper _encapsulation_ (private fields, accessible by public `get` and `set` methods) while demonstrating interactions between objects (e.g., having the object communicate with the world). Hope you find it useful!
